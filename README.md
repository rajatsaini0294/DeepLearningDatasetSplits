DeepLearningDatasetSplits
=========================
Scripts to split the Image datasets into train and test sets

## UCSD BIRDS 200

Heirarchy of the setup: 

Place the script in the same directory as the images ([dowload](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html)) and the train/test text split files ([download](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/visipedia/CUB-200.html))

```
  |
  |--ucsd_birds_test_train_split.py
  |--images (downloaded images)
  |--train (will be created by script itself)
  |--test (will be created by script itself)
  |--train.txt
  |--test.txt
```
